This is my Hello World GitHub Repo for Spring 2023 GIST 604B
I currently live in Oceanside, California which is along the coast in the northern part of San Diego County. I enjoy the backpacking, hiking, rock climbing, and camping in our converted van as frequently as possible.  
I am enjoying learning the newer technology and programs in GIS.  A lot has changed from when I first started in the GIS field about 20 years ago.
